Setting fires to cars that can explode and kill people, burning your neighborhood does not solve problems. It creates them. Yes people are angry and they deserve to be but those creating fires and pillaging are not honoring Mr. Floyd they are honoring their own agendas not racism,anger

More Democrats need to follow Keisha Bottom’s example. Obama, Warren, Harris, Biden, Abrams, they all need to be discouraging the riots. And if idiots like Chomsky and Sanders care to, they should too. Get the angry progressives to calm down b/c this is all counterproductive. ,anger

Just so you are aware. I am black, I am angry, I want justice. That doesn't mean I'm gonna go looting and rioting. I want peace like most folks. There is no excuse for those folks trashing their cities. They don't represent the people actually trying to bring change.,anger

People are angry, sad, disappointed, appalled, scared, betrayed and hurt. How could they not be? If authorities use force and ignore an urgent need for reform/justice, protests will return sooner or later, perhaps stronger. Ppl are being loud and clear. Y'all should listen.,anger
Not angry bro, just kind of sad that this is I think what all you guys wanted, chaos. this is not justice, this is not protest, this is just fighting the establishment and the authority and people are instigating. What’s the point of destroying things instead of rebuilding.,anger

I agree, we can’t be too quick to just cancel him. Why would he put him in his song for no reason? The song could’ve been a diss track so we should let yoongi explain himself. I understand that people are angry, and I cant blame them. But we should hear him out first.,anger

EVERYONE was more than saddened and angry that George Floyd was killed by these policemen . But battling their criminal behavior with more criminal behavior solves nothing - it leads to chaos and ill-will. George Floyd in his own prophetic words condemned such behavior.,anger
If you find yourself defending these THUGS Then find another country to support. We don’t condone violence. Burning down 170+ businesses built on the backs by law abiding citizens. You’re not angry about Floyd. You’re just a FELON who needs a jail cell Pathetic,anger

An undercover officer will wear a headband, wristband or other piece of clothing in the same color as the "color of the day", the color is told to officers at the precinct before they start work. The system first started during the violence of 1970s & 1980s New York City.,anger

Standing up for something is one thing. I believe in standing up for what you believe in is right. But let’s stand in love and not hate. We are angry. We are hurt. What happened is wrong. We can fix things if we learn that things do not have to be divided in race. ,anger

Honest question—what was your position on Kapernick taking a knee? Right or wrong—the looters are angry and this is how they communicate it. They watched a man be murdered—and saw no reaction/action. Agree—disagree—I’m a privileged white man—I can’t begin to understand,anger
