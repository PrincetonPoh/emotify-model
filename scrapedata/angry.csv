Honest question—what was your position on Kapernick taking a knee? Right or wrong—the looters are angry and this is how they communicate it. They watched a man be murdered—and saw no reaction/action. Agree—disagree—I’m a privileged white man—I can’t begin to understand,anger

Taking a one tweet break from the angry angry things I am feeling to tell you that if you want to know about the coolest form of land management you’ve ever heard of, go look at silvipastures. They deserve all the worship and praise.,anger
This is all apart of a chain reaction caused by the government’s lack of responsibility... the people are trying to make a statement and they are incredibly angry. They want our country to listen.,anger

okay so like i just wanna day this. don’t get angry at people who are tweeting but not about the BLM movement. They are allowed to not want to speak on it just as much as you are allowed to speak on it. Everyone has the right to do what they want (speaking or not speaking on it),anger

Nothing has shaken me quite like the killing of George Floyd has in a long time. Every time I think about it I get angry. How can you do that as a human being? A man begging for his life, only for you to casually ignore him. Today and always, #blacklivesmatter,anger
Oh noooo! This makes me so angry!! Used to get me down too! Words mean nothing! You’re a wonderful person, and they have no right!! Keep smiling ,anger
Let the city burn, let it burn. A riot is the language of the unheard. THIS is what happens when we are tired of peaceful protest, broken promises, continued dysfunction. You can’t light the world on fire with your evil and be angry when you see fire. #GeorgeFloydWasMurdered,anger

you don’t have to be black to advocate or to feel angry about what’s going on!!! the system has never worked for black people, so why let them stand alone? it shows where you stand if you aren’t saying anything, not a retweet or ig story but go off with ur selfies i guess,anger

As long as angry white folks carry AR15s to protest in front of state capitol buildings all is well. But serious burning down one’s own neighborhood is a bad look.,anger
I don't give a fu$k about Trump. I voted for dems in every election. I am angry at Amy for letting go of the police officer. Had she taken action, George would be alive today. I never voted for Republicans and will never vote for them. I will vote for @GreenPartyUS this time.,anger

Like uncovering incidents and stories no one even heard of like “while you’re at it and angry, check this out too”.... Not saying it’s not relevant and doesn’t deserve attention but I can only take in and address so much racist bullshit at a time.,anger
Right. Bishop I am angry o. ,anger
I guess people are mad because the truth hurts? I am mixed race and my white mum would kill anyone who hurt me, but she believed that all Muslims were terrorists and she called her husband a 'black bastard' when she was angry. She would claim her hubby/kids prove she isn't racist,anger
no black person is killing another black person for BEING BLACK while police officers doing just that. ain't nobody saying it isn't a problem and it's organizations fighting just that. but right now you using it to invalidate the way that people are angry,anger
Holding in when in angry is so so hard for me mannnnn,anger

#ETTD Trump has created a lot of angry people out there. Please take care of one another. Trump will get his. Epstein’s cell awaits. ,anger

Since the Trump shit show hit I've been angry. But yesterday/today... I feel absolute rage at the shit that's going on. A white supremacists in the WH calling for violence, white cops killing black men, mass protests during an unchecked pandemic, 103K dead... #TheUSIsAFailedState,anger
> implying all of other my ocs aren't already angry women of color,anger
MS is profiling angry and upset CPP as at-risk mentally unstable in his next article instigated by his anger at #25PsychoCPP aka #Borderlines. With that, he's trying to justify UDT, and his coveted 28% proclamation. These 'unity' leaders seem to agree.,anger

Hahaha roja chusava hahahha,anger
A late start but it's a double feature sort of night and the challenge continues with 12 Angry Men! ,anger
Borrowing something @AhsanDeliri said but it bears repeating: social media is figuratively (if not literally) operated by Hilary Clinton supporters angry they're operating in a Trump world. It incenses them. Hence, the pretence of platform neutrality gives way to bias publishing.,anger
people are angry about this because the action was not "non-violent" and it was not an "accident",anger
Just so so so so so so so so angry right now.,anger
I wonder if the cameras and press credentials helped make that determination.,anger
I disagree with this. White people have to be violent, and have to be angry. Put your body on the line. Show other white people what it means to support Black people. ,anger
My young son said he he understood why folks in #Minneapolis were rioting and asked what did I expect? He stated “they’er angry!” I replied, “I expect them to #vote! Especially in local elections!”,anger
If you learn life’s lessons, you will do well. If not, life will just continue to push you around. Others get angry and push back not knowing it is life that is pushing.,anger
Be angry. Be scared. Speak out. Use your voice. Fight for a better tomorrow. And most importantly, please. PLEASE. Be safe.,anger
Section 230 protects free speech on the internet. You are defending Trump wanting to remove that protection while pretending that you understand the implications. You have no idea what you're talking about and neither does Trump. Trump us angry that Twitter said the truth.,anger

That's fair. I'm doing his last because it has the most traditionally Resident Evil climax with a rocket launcher, which I'm sentimental for. Also, playing Chris' campaign first back in the day genuinely made me think that Ada had gone bad, and so the reveals were more natural.,anger
im so angry but this is their fault too they spoiled him although they just wanted to be supportive ,anger

I go away for 5 MINUTES and look what happened. This convo has gone pear-shaped. Like my butt.,anger
It’s like raising a little kid. If you tell people to use their words before they get angry, listen to them. Otherwise they’re going to get angry, and it’ll be justified. And if you’re mad that they’re mad, redirect your anger or you’re part of the problem.,anger
why in fuck are you gatekeeping the tone of voice i use when i am angry at people who aren’t doing shit and just keep tweeting about kpop boys ,anger
Yes you did. When Peter drew the sword and cut the guards ear off, Jesus reprimanded Peter and healed the one taking Him captive. Jesus was not angry with the guard, He was angry with one of His own. He Teaches volumes in that one act.,anger
-These are very good people, but they are angry -These THUGS are dishonoring the memory of George Floyd -They want their lives back again, safely! See them, talk to them, make a deal -Any difficultly and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts ,anger
They should not have to be “fighting against” a system that was built for us and against them, how they choose to fight is not up to us. We should be angry too, and use it as fuel to become more educated in active anti-racism.,anger

donald trump withdrawing funds to the WHO and pretty much allowing the military to open fire on his own citizens just shows what kind of a disgusting and inhumane person he is. IM SO ANGRY,anger
Hey man it ok to be angry. This year has been just the worst for most of us and it ok to feeling the way that you do. It’s best that you talked about it rather then just bottling it up.,anger
