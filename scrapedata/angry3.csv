LOL yes I understand your off colored joke when a business owner is standing in solidarity with a city that’s angry and sick of being treated like dogs. And if you’re going to label something as sarcasm, then it’s literally made to mock and show contempt. The jokes continue!,anger

Too late. I’ve come to the conclusion that most people don’t actually want change. They want the right to be angry. Or more people would realize what a colossal wasted opportunity this was,anger
Such a irresponsible headline story. Talk about throwing gasoline on the fire. Yes people are right to feel angry and frustrated at a system that ignores them. Most protesters are peaceful most just want the system to work. #BadJournalism makes it out to be something else.,anger

I'm angry that you are so ignorant of what is going on you're so sure that you're correct but you attack anyone who even slightly disagrees with you. It's a bad look for anyone. It's an especially bad look for someone who's Twitter handle identifies her as a Jew.,anger
You don't have to be black to be angry about racism towards black people that is continuously happening all around the world. Just be a fucking human being. #BlackLivesMatters,anger

"walking" lol yea just jogging too right .,anger
America has all right to be angry. But on another note, please stay safe!,anger
Hey they hurt, upset, & angry do what you gotta do to get their attention ,anger
Every right to be angry at the issues, but that’s a horrible excuse.,anger
You’re not getting on twitter or keeping up with social media because looking at the news makes you upset and angry?? You’re supposed to be upset and angry, you’re supposed to act on it and do anything to help, donate, protest, spread the word, do anything tk make sure-,anger
Point taken but not 100%. ANTIFA is leading the burning and destruction. BLM could just go home. Smarter than getting blamed. And BLM will be blamed. There are plenty of angry BLM people looting and rioting.,anger
I SEE YOU,anger
Now I don’t... I’m okay with being different, simple, modest, WEIRD, “broke” “hoe” “angry black woman” “aggressive” whatever y’all want.... b/c in reality I’m THAT B*TCH. ,anger

CNN is a symbol of the establishment and is a target of a lot of hate of young people because of their propaganda.Think Bernies 2016 and 2020 Campaign have something to do with young people being angry at CNN. Its CNNs own fault and this Propaganda Network deserves this and worse,anger
The lesson of history is that violence often does not get you what you want in the long term. While people are understandably angry about police brutality, there are better ways to convey it than burning and looting. #GeorgeFloyd,anger
Standing up for something is one thing. I believe in standing up for what you believe in is right. But let’s stand in love and not hate. We are angry. We are hurt. What happened is wrong. We can fix things if we learn that things do not have to be divided in race. ,anger
I just checked out CNN it is 1143 Mt time right now and do you believe they’re showing all different views about the murder and arrest of George Floyd in different views. More proof this is set up. And you know they’re doing it just to try to get more people angry,anger
The truth of the matter is that it is hard being a minority. No one believes you, violence against you can be "justified", when you talk about it, you're said to be wrong/angry/spewing hate. There is no justice. The lived experiences of minorities are the same everywhere.,anger
They’re responsible for what’s happening,anger
“Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your wrath:” Ephesians 4:26 KJV ,anger

Haan you were born to see his anger or you have seen a video of him getting angry? Stop your abject NONSENSE. You are an imbecile who is clueless about Akbar’s contributions to India. He was the first ruler of a largely united India. And no you are not worth further debate!,anger
Remember this, my dear brothers and sisters! Everyone must be quick to listen, but slow to speak and slow to become angry. James 1:19 GNBDK https://bible.com/bible/431/jas.1.19.GNBDK https://www.instagram.com/p/CAzQUwipNOX/?igshid=1dwgip2g59yb1,anger
Black and brown people in America are rightfully angry. This is just the beginning.,anger

“Go ahead and be angry. You do well to be angry—but don’t use your anger as fuel for revenge. And don’t stay angry. Don’t go to bed angry. Don’t give the Devil that kind of foothold in your life.” Ephesians 4:26 MSG ,anger
If you’re not angry you’re not paying attention. #GeorgeFloydMurder #JusticeForGeorge,anger
-On. Same goes for around 300 years as well (tho ofc humans and most animals cannot live up to 300 years, a few still can). So, when I say that saying stuff such as: (TW for racism and slavery)-,anger
And “don’t sin by letting anger control you.” Don’t let the sun go down while you are still angry, Ephesians 4:26 NLT ,anger
Did your police dept, mayor, govenor disappear on you? If so, I'd be really angry about them not doing their jobs.,anger
The only one I disagree with is Icies. Fuck icies. They at the bottom,anger

Nice excessive use for angry emojis my dude,anger
the black people there have the right to be angry, I'm upset on why this has to happen, seeing people actually die for ridiculous reasons so easily....;;; imagine you live for 40 years and have families and everything and a police kills you for holding a toy in your hand or sth,anger
People are dragging her saying “do something” as if she hasn’t recently changed her entire life trying to. @KimKardashian has helped free 17 people in the last 3 months. Let’s not forget we’re all angry at the SYSTEM, including her. She is making changes in this world. Respect it,anger
Someone innocent is going to get shot then it really will get even worse please be careful people also the virus hasn’t gone yet think of all the Dr’s and nurses who you are dishonouring however angry you rightly are. Peace from ,anger

I’m angry that the last public starlight tour in Saskatchewan occurred in 2018. I’m angry about George Floyd’s murder. I’m angry that a cop pushed and concussed a young woman peacefully protesting.,anger
I was Sha wondering what's making them angry. People truly don't read,anger

Shoutouts to the people that are actually angry,disgusted,and upset about what’s going on and trying to stand for something, and not just taking advantage of riots just to get free shit.,anger
im so angry to hear what happened at my city today, my heart goes out to the protestors who had to deal with a fucking terrorist trying to run them over. this is unacceptable,anger
I’m angry. I’m beyond angry that this is the fucking state of the world we live in. Angry that the fucking Cheeto Overlord decided to call open season on black people and protestors.,anger
why are you more angry about buildings and cars than you are about black people’s lives??? make it make sense.,anger

Cause she saw I was getting angry and this dude was just spewing shit, he also dropped out and I am so glad he did cause I couldn’t stand his stupid looking face,anger
Of course it was murder. This is so dishonest saying that people aren’t angry about it. You’re virtue signaling, it’s so sad. You are a shock value leftist.,anger
Hypothetical? It just happened with those guys who chased down the black jogger. They weren't charged, video comes out they got charged. Not sure storming the White House is a good idea but the black community is justifiably angry. And all anger eventually explodes. Human nature,anger
A ^total^ knob. I'd have been very angry if that was my son. No prep, no gear, and when it got too hard, it was easier to call for a tow. ^And^ he'd do it all again.,anger

Thanks for the follow.,anger

chris cuomo said not to victimize cnn and that it is not the only building that was damaged.... these protestors are frustrated, unheard and angry. WE NEED CHANGE, IMPROVEMENT!!!! A building is not more important than a black life! ,anger
He’s the president, Ann, not the frickin Wizard of Oz.,anger
Yeah. I understand it tho. I been thru this with Mike Brown, Trayvon Martin, Eric Garner. I spent two years being angry. It was enough to make me not watch the news ever again. Its too much for me now. Maybe not everyone is quiet for reasons @CeddyOrNot pointed out (selfish PR),anger
I am super annoyed with those who started all this but what makes me most angry is that there are “Armys” with their fake lil 7 attacking him and trying to cancel him,anger
Bring back @BarackObama @MichelleObama we need y'all more than ever... COME save us again.... Everything y'all helped build is being destroyed and now we're angry... only God can help this I know but someway somehow we need to hear y'all voice and motivational words.... ,anger
I'm just saying the facts, why are you angry? ,anger
Idk, white anarchist types are too busy burning down black small businesses and assisted living homes to care, in Minnesota, call back later. Are you angry at the white anarchists yet, for putting black people further down into poverty?,anger
I’m angry and you should be too,anger
I’m not here to come after you or say “gotcha,” to be clear. What you posted was just very, very tone deaf and as a fellow game dev and Sonic enthusiast I EMPLORE you to understand *why* people are angry and research why what’s happening is happening.,anger
Watching these protests unfold live on TV is making me so angry. I just don’t understand why our country had to be like this. We already have enough hate in the world. Please stop all this hate. It’s not worth it. #BlackLivesMatter,anger
I’m gonna stop commenting on everything that’s been going on lately so I don’t make anyone angry with me, because while I can be pretty toxic and honestly a bad person, while I regret all this, my last message about this matter is #BlackLivesMatter,anger
Everyone should be fucking angry right now.... PEOPLE ARE BEING MURDERED. DO BETTER.,anger
